How to use

Run maven build to compile this Spring Boot Application into a executable jar,
Then run the jar to start the RestAPI server using the following command:

java -jar TemplateEngine-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar start


It is also possible to run a packaged application with remote debugging support enabled. This allows you to attach a debugger to your packaged application:

$ java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=8000,suspend=n \
       -jar target/myproject-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
       
       
19.3 Using the Maven plugin
The Spring Boot Maven plugin includes a run goal which can be used to quickly compile and run your application. Applications run in an exploded form just like in your IDE.

$ mvn spring-boot:run
